# SimonGame
Simon is an electronic memory game featuring four colored buttons. It starts with a button lighting up and emitting a sound, forming a sequence. Players must replicate the sequence by pressing the corresponding buttons in the correct order. Successful replication extends the sequence, increasing difficulty. Mistakes end the game. Scoring is based on completed rounds.
